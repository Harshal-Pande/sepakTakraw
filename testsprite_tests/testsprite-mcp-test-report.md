## Key Issues to Fix (Prioritized)
1) Restore admin access path
- Map public nav to `app/admin/login/page.js` or correct entry route.
- Ensure `middleware.js` and `lib/auth.js` allow access to login page; fix `/governance` link to real admin path.

2) Fix player-registration step 1 API
- Inspect `app/api/player-registration/step1/route.js` for missing body validation, DB insert, or Supabase errors.
- Return `{ success: true, data: { reference_number } }` on 200; handle errors with 4xx where appropriate.

3) Re-enable client-side validation on forms
- In `app/player-registration/step1/page.js`, enforce required checks and show `Alert` on invalid inputs.
- Implement validation hooks/utilities from `lib/validations.js` consistently.

4) Add Event Registration component on event detail
- Mount `components/common/EventRegistration.js` in `app/events/[id]/page.js`; wire POST API.

5) Fix broken navigation and missing routes
- Replace or remove `/governance` links; verify all nav URLs exist.

6) Address image 400 errors and Next/Image warnings
- Ensure files in `public/Logos` match case-sensitive paths used by `next/image`.
- Add `sizes` when using `fill`; add `priority` for above-the-fold LCP images.

7) Admin auth flow
- Verify `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/verify` semantics. Allow local test credentials and proper session setup.

## Artifacts
- Raw: `testsprite_tests/tmp/raw_report.md`
- Test plan: `testsprite_tests/testsprite_frontend_test_plan.json`

## Suggested Retest Steps
- Fix items 1–3 first; re-run TC001/TC002 to validate registration flow.
- Restore admin entry; re-run TC003/TC004/TC006/TC010.
- Mount event registration; re-run TC005 and TC015.
- Correct nav links; re-run TC012/TC014/TC016.
